## 🎯 Deploy Backend NOW (30 seconds!)

**I've opened the Render Blueprint page in your browser.**

### Just click these 3 buttons:

1. **Select Repository**: Click on `Sport-Bike-Portfolio`
2. **Blueprint Name**: Leave as default or name it `sport-bike-backend`
3. **Click "Apply"** (Render will read render.yaml automatically!)

That's it! All environment variables are already configured in render.yaml.

## ⏱️ After Backend Deploys (2 minutes)

### You'll see your backend URL like: 
`https://sport-bike-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`

### Copy that URL and run:

```powershell
node update-frontend.js https://sport-bike-backend-xxxx.onrender.com
```

This will connect your frontend to backend and you're DONE!
